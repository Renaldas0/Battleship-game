# Welcome to my Battleships game 
This game is a single player game against AI and is Coded entirely on python. Instructions on how to play are given once the game is run.

## Requirements

- You will be required to have an editor that can run python code to play this game
- A recommendation I have is PyCharm 
- Link to download PyCharm can be found here : https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

## How the game works

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

## Features
## Unfixed Bugs
## Debugging
## Testing
## Deployment
## Credits

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!
